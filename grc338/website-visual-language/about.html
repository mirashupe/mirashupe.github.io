                    <p class="about">At Centaur Ice Cream, our journey began with John and Linda in a small, cozy kitchen in the heart of a bustling coastal town. It all started with a passion for creating something simple, yet extraordinary—a treat that could bring people together and create lasting memories. What began as an experiment with old family recipes and locally-sourced ingredients soon blossomed into a full-fledged ice cream business, fueled by a dream to craft the creamiest, most flavorful ice creams that anyone could enjoy. With every scoop, we strive to deliver not just a dessert, but an experience.</p>
                    <p class="about">The name "Centaur" comes from the Greek legend of a half-human, half-horse creature, symbolizing our commitment to balance—combining the magical, wild spirit of adventure with the grounded, artisanal craft of ice cream making. We source the finest ingredients from local farms and global purveyors, ensuring that each batch of our ice cream is as pure and flavorful as it is imaginative. Whether it's our rich, dark chocolate with a hint of sea salt or our bold, one-of-a-kind flavors like honey-lavender and roasted pistachio, every recipe is carefully designed to stir the senses and spark curiosity.</p>
                    <p class="about">At Centaur Ice Cream, we don't just make ice cream; we create an experience. Every cone is an invitation to step into a world where innovation meets tradition, and every bite is a journey of discovery. We believe that the joy of a truly great ice cream should be shared with everyone, from the little ones licking their cones to the grown-ups savoring a quiet moment of indulgence. So come, find your favorite flavor, and join us in celebrating the magic of ice cream, one legendary scoop at a time.</p>
